Stock universes
===============

This example module is
`available in the repository <https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxportfolio/blob/master/examples/universes.py>`_.
See the docstring below for its explanation. It's used by other examples 
to get lists of stock tickers corresponding to various indexes. We run
it periodically to update the lists to the current constituents of each
index.
