Original examples from the paper
================================

*Work in progress.*

These are the original examples, which were also used to generate plots
and results in :paper:`chapter 7 of the paper <chapter.7>`. They were
originally written as IPython notebook, and have been translated into Python
code using the stable API of Cvxportfolio (*i.e.*, version ``1.0.0`` and 
above). 

The original notebooks are `available on this branch of the repository
<https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxportfolio/blob/0.0.X/examples/>`_.

.. note::

   Currently some of them are *work in progress*, refer to the linked notebook
   if in doubt.
